# Panel_for_drivers

## Concept

Our goal for this scholar project was to create a device that can allow the driver of a vehicle (car, motorcycle, bike, etc) to transmit some emotions to the driver(s) behind him.  
We choose a graphic representation of this emotions, so that they can be displayed easily with a led panel, with the utilisation of emoticons. For example, with our device, the user could print on the led panel behind the vehicle :  

* An angry emoticon (if some car behind him is too close, etc)
* A thumbs up (to thanks some other driver for a good behavior)
* Some text
* Anything he want to express to an other driver !    

It should be possible for the user to control the led panel with the help of a website, that can be accessed on the same network that the device is connected.  
With this website, the user will be able to call 6 patterns (with the help of buttons), that will be transmitted to the led panel.  
6 others buttons will be dedicated to the modification of this patterns individually. The user can modify a pattern by choosing a color, and selecting each pixel that should display this color. For a reason of simplicity, only one color will be displayed in the led panel. Then, he'll can save his modification, and on the next click on the button of this pattern, the new one will be displayed.
